# Info
+ About the Line Renderer
+   It was found the line genereated by the line renderer cannot be see in the `game` tab, but can be viewed in the `scene` tab and player can see the line using the VR headset.

+ Bonus Achieved:
+   Bonus 1: When the laser hits the balloon, add torque to the balloon and deflate it (via interpolation). When the balloon reaches a certain minimum size, have it drop to the ground
+   Bonus 3: Use the laser to apply a short duration force to the balloon (the balloon should fall to the ground under gravity if no force is applied).
